<p>Economic growth in the 20th and early
21st centuries has been rapid, outpacing
population increases. In 1960, Europe and
North America generated 75% of global GDP
with only 20% of the worldâ€™s population.</p>
<p>By 2018, East Asia surpassed both in GDP,
driven by Japan, South Korea, and China.</p>
<p>In the coming decades, economists predict
that South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa
will lead global economic growth.</p>
