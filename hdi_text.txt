<p>HDI, or Human Development Index, aims to
measure the overall standard of living in
countries. It considers factors such as
life expectancy, GDP per capita, and
educational attainment.<p>
</p>Economic growth in the developing world
during the 21st century may help other
regions catch up to North America and Europe.</p>
<p>One crucial factor not included in HDI is
electricity consumption. Access to
electricity enables significant productivity
gains. Developing nations should invest
in energy production to foster continued growth.</p>
